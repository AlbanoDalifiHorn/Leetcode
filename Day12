class Solution:
    def maximumCount(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        resMax = 0
        resMin = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > 0:
                resMax += 1
            elif nums[i] < 0:
                resMin += 1
        return max(resMax, resMin)

# It's possible to solve it in O(log(n)), because we know the array is sorted, but O(n) is working aswell thats why I stick to my solution :)
