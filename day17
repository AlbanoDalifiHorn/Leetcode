class Solution:
    def divideArray(nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        dic = defaultdict(int)
        counter = 0
        n = len(nums) // 2
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] in dic:
                dic[nums[i]] += 1
            else:
                dic[nums[i]] = 1
        for val in dic.values():
            if val % 2 == 0:
                counter += val // 2
        return counter == n

Idea: we gonna create a dic to save all values to the keys, after that we are gonna look how many pairs we can build based on the frequency of the value and if counter == n -> True else False
much easier is to use the following approach: 
counter=collections.Counter(nums)
it automatically creates a dic with all keys and values, so its much less code
